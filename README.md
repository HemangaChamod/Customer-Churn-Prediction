# Customer Churn Prediction System

## Project Overview
This project predicts customer churn for subscription-based services (e.g., telecom companies). Using historical customer data, the system forecasts whether a customer is likely to leave (churn) or stay. These predictions help businesses take proactive retention actions to reduce churn and improve customer loyalty.

The project includes:
- **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**: Prepare and optimize customer data for modeling.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build models using Logistic Regression and Decision Trees.
- **Web-based Frontend**: Flask application for user input and displaying predictions.
- **Visualization**: Display predicted churn probabilities for better insights.
